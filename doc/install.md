Installation
============

Install the latest version with:

```bash
$ composer require mouf/mouf ~2.0.0
$ composer require mouf/database.tdbm
```

So far, TDBM requires the Mouf PHP framework for the UI part (it uses the Mouf user interface for configuration and 
generation).
This dependency might be removed in TDBM 4.1.

Once composer install is done, access the Mouf user interface (http://[your server]/[your app]/vendor/mouf/mouf).
In the user interface, run the graphical installer.

The installer will help you set up the complete environment.
